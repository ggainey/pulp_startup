W = a Worker
RR = a ReservedResource
T =incoming Task-request

Current:
# One id associated to one ReservedResource handled by one Worker
# Worker for that resource may already be busy - queue new request onto it
# else create new Worker and queue
apply_async_with_reservation(resource-id)
    worker = worker-name associated with ReservedResource for resource-id
    if 1:
      W = worker
    if 0:
      W = create Worker
      if no-workers-avail, sleep() and retry)

    RR = create ReservedResource(W, resource-id)
    RR.task = T
    return W



Desired:
# Multiple ReservedResources can be associated with one Worker
# We have to wait until there is AT MOST one Worker dealing with ReservedResource(s)
#    associated with the ids on the incoming list
# When there is one Worker, create ReservedResources for each id in the incoming list, and
#    hand all of them to that one Worker
# When there are no Workers handling any of the incoming resources, create one and hand
#    it that list of ReservedResources
# If there are no Workers available in the second case, wait and try again

apply_async_with_reservations(list-of-ids])  # NOTE THE PLURAL - this is a new API
    [workers] = worker-names for all Workers associated with any resource in list
    if len(workers) > 1: # more than one worker is handling resource(s) in incoming req
      sleep() and retry
    elseif len(workers) == 1: # There exists only one worker dealing w/any of our rsrcs; add to its queue
      W = workers[0]
    elseif len(workers) == 0: # Nobody is dealing w/any of our resources - time for new worker
      W = create_worker()
      if fails due to "too many workers", sleep and retry

    At this point we have a Worker, a Task, and a list of resources.

    ATOMIC-TRANSACTION-REQUIRED:
      foreach rid in list-of-resources:
         RR = find-or-create ReservedResource(W, rid)
         RR.task = T


THOUGHTS:
could use same API:
  change _queue_reserved_task method to take type and id, investigate incoming resource-id,
    if-list (or string containing magic char (eg, | ?)) then do multi-resource processing else
    do existing?
  PRO: only _queue_reserved_task API changes
  CON: method could get opaquely-complicated

  add _queue_reserved_multi_task method, same investigation happens in apply_async_with_reservation
  PRO: clearer separaton of concersn
  CON: possibly not as DRY as it could be?

  in both cases:
  CON: resource-id passed to apply_async_with_reservation becomes 'magic', ew
