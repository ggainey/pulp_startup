#
# Brute-force approach to making it possible to build just the static-docs-pages
# for pulpcore.
#
# Notes:
# 1) This is UGLY, but it seems to work.
# 2) The same approach should work for building docs in plugins, but the docs.patch
#    may not apply; use it as a guideline.
# 3) The 'dirhtml' target skips trying to build the REST API docs
# 4) 'python -m http.server 8010' starts a webserver with current-working-directory as
#    its root. You can access the pages therein at 'http://localhost:8010'
#
# This process has been tested on a 'bare' install of Fedora32.
#
# We need git and make and virtualenvwrapper
sudo dnf install git make
pip3 install --user virtualenvwrapper
# If virtualenvwrapper.sh isn't here, you can look for it with
# the command 'find / -name virtualenvwrapper.sh'
source ~/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
# Set up to use workon
export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs
mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME
# Make an environment for docs
mkvirtualenv docs
workon docs
# Grab pulpcore
git clone https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore.git
cd pulpcore/
# Apply the brute-force fixes to let the build work(ish)
# They can be found as 'docs.patch' in this directory
git apply docs.patch
# Install *only* the docs-requirements (the patch removes the intstall of requirements.txt)
pip install -r doc_requirements.txt
# Go to and build the docs
cd ./docs
# SO many errors here - ignore them
make dirhtml
# Start a webserver, at port 8010
cd _build/dirhtml/
python -m http.server 8010
